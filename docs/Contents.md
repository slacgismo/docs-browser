# Contents

The left pane displays the contents of the `docs` folder in the branch of the project owned by the user/org.  Only `.md` documents are displayed in the Table of Contents.  Clicking on a document will load it in the right pane.

In addition, any folders will also be shown above the list of documents.  Clicking on a folder will display the documents in that folder in an indented list below the folder's name. Clicking on folder again will hide the indented list. Clicking on an another folder will also hide the indented list before displaying the documents in the other folder.
